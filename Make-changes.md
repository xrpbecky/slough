If you are modifying a file that exists in your fork of the OVAL Language, editing a file is as simple as:

1. Creating a [new issue](../issues/new) explaining the rationale for the change
2. Selecting the file in your fork of the OVAL Language
3. Clicking the "Edit this file" button
3. Making the changes to the file
4. Adding a commit message that references the issue number
5. Saving the changes by clicking the "Commit Changes" button

Changes to your fork of the OVAL Language (e.g. add files, modify files, delete files, etc.) can also be made by following the [normal workflow] (http://learn.github.com/p/normal.html) of modifying a Git repository.
