# Schema Documentation

Annotation-derived (generated) [schema documentation](../blob/master/docs/README.md) is included in the Git repository for the current version of OVAL.  The markdown documentation pages are generated from the schemas using the [oval_xsd2md.xsl transform](../blob/master/tools/oval_xsd2md.xsl) located in the project's tools directory.

# Specification Documents

Microsoft Word format [specification documents](../tree/master/specifications) are also maintained in the Git repository in the specifications directory.
